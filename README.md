PROJECT TITLE - Web Scraping with Streamlit Application

PROJECT DESCRIPTION - 
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to scrape and display information about doctors available in a user-specified city and specialization. 
The application interacts with a medical website 'Practo.com', extracting data such as doctor names and profile links based on user inputs. 
The app interface allows users to enter a city name and select a specialization from a predefined list, making it easy to find relevant medical professionals in the desired location.

Step - 2 : Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
           python -m venv env
           source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
